# Governance

This repository is maintained by a small working group of maintainers listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`. Decisions are made by consensus. For larger changes, propose a design document via an issue or PR, collect feedback, and secure at least two maintainer approvals before merging. Security fixes may be fast-tracked at maintainer discretion.
